Enthusiastic `iOS developer` with a strong foundation in mobile application development. I actively engage in personal projects to further my skills and explore new functionalities.<br/><br/> I possess a deep passion for Swift and SwiftUI, and I contribute to the developer community by `maintaining open-source libraries` and assisting others on platforms like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6290902/anbalagan-d) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@anbalagand).
